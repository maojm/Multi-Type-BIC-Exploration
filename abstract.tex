It is common in recommendation systems that users both produce and consume information as they make strategic choices under uncertainty. While a social planner would balance “exploration” and “exploitation” using a multi-armed bandit algorithm, users’ incentives may tilt this balance in favor of exploitation. We consider Bayesian Exploration: a simple model in which the recommendation system (the “principal”) controls the information flow to the users (the “agents”) and strives to incentivize exploration via information asymmetry. A single round of this model is a well-known “Bayesian Persuasion game” from (Kamenica and Gentzkow, 2011). We allow heterogeneous users, relaxing a major assumption from prior work that users have the same preferences from one time step to another. The goal is now to learn the best \emph{personalized} recommendations. We consider several versions of the model, depending on whether the user types are public or private and what is the communication protocol between the principal and the users, and design a near-optimal “recommendation policy” for each version. One particular challenge is that it may be impossible to incentivize some of the user types to take some of the actions, no matter what the principal does or how much time she has. We also investigate how the model choice impacts the set of actions that can possibly be “explored” by each type.
